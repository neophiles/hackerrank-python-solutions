# HackerRank Python Solutions

This repository is a collection of my Python solutions to coding challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  
All problems are grouped by **difficulty** into three main categories: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.

## Folder Structure

- [Easy](./Easy) – Solutions to easy-level problems  
- [Medium](./Medium) – Solutions to medium-level problems  
- [Hard](./Hard) – Solutions to hard-level problems

Each solution file is named based on the problem title (with underscores for spaces) and may include a brief description or comments.

## Language

- Python 3

## Purpose

- To practice and improve my Python programming skills

- To build a helpful resource for others on a similar journey

## Disclaimer

All solutions are my own unless otherwise noted.
